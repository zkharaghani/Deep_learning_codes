Convolutional Neural Networks: Step by Step
You will be implementing the building blocks of a convolutional neural network! Each function you will implement will have detailed instructions to walk you through the steps:

Convolution functions, including:
Zero Padding
Convolve window
Convolution forward
Convolution backward (optional)
